# GCI-Task-from-FOSSASIA
I already had a github account with the username “rhemon”. Now I simply love github. Putting aside the amazing version control from git, that often saves me from messing up my whole project, Github has made the option to open projects and share it with friends for contribution. Till now I have many created many repositories of the practice project that I did. I also created repositories for the project that I am doing for my school website - ehswebsite. This way my teacher and friends woring with me can keep track of my progress while also I am also able to use the github pages option let me test my website. This brings the other amazing option of github that is use - github pages. I love how they have open free hosting for simple pages. This gave me now the chance to show off my web designing skills to my friends and family, without spending any money. Presently I am working building my own website, hosting with github pages. 

Beside my own projects, Github is a place where there are many communities sharing their work with the world. Sometimes when I am doing some project, if I find it very difficult to do it myself, I try searching existing projects that did something similar, and take help from other’s code. For example when I was making and android app for my school canteen I was having a tough time adding Google Sign in so used some other people’s repositories for reference.
