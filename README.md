# How I use Git and GitHub
I already had a github account with the username “rhemon” before this task. Github is one of the most amazing thing I have ever found.

# Git

Git is pretty much everyday tool that I used no matter what kind of project I do. As we know git is version control, it helps me keep track of my work as I continue working on it. There were many cases where I was saved by git. Here I will talk about two incidents where git really helped me out. First scenario was when I was working on an android app, I somehow ended up deleting some of my drawable files. It was dumb of me to not realize that and was getting worried about my mistake. It was also stupid of me to not keep any backup file of the drawables that I had. Later on through google search I came to know about `git checkout` which really saved me from a lot of hard work. 

The other scenario where git really helped me out was when I was doing making website. While making changes in css I made some mistakes and for some reason my site started acting wierd. In the normal inspect mode, I found everything normal and was unable to find the mistake. To be honest I was so annoyed that I ended up deleting my whole code and started rewriting the code from scratch making sure every step was being correct. Once I was rebuilt the part that wasn't functioning properly I calmed down and used `git checkout` to get back the old code. Then used git to find differences and to be honest and I found out not only I left out some important styling but also made some spelling mistakes for some of the properties. 

Just like that git really helped me out on finding bugs, keeping backups and provided me a lot of power to manage projects more efficiently. 

# GitHub

Putting aside the amazing version control from git, Github made it a lot easier to work on projects. The ability to keep track of every change I make in my project helps me look out for errors, especially during web designing. When making websites it's really common to make some typos when changing css or html. Through github I can easily find the changes that caused the problem and quickly fix it. Secondly in Github I am able to keep backups. As I learn new thing everyday, I like to keep my practice projects with me, so that I can refer to those when needed. However storing them all in my local storage would consume a lot of space. With Github I can simply make my practice projects a repository and keep it as backup in github and clone it whenever I need it. This allows me to free a lot of space in my local storage.

Beside having backups and version control, the other thing that I love most about Github is Github pages. The free hosting service for simple webpages made it a lot easier for me to create and share my work with others. Thanks to Github, I am also being able to create my own website without any expense. Lastly, there are lots of communities and developers sharing their work on Github. This way if I am having a tough time doing something in my project, for example in one of my android application I was finding it difficult to add Google Sign In. Therefore I searched and forked some other developer's work to use as reference while I build my application. I am only able to do this because of having Github. I really thank the who brought Github and people and did not make it commercial so that students like me are also able to use such amazing resources for learning new things.
